# Hello, World!

Welcome to my new blog! This is a simple example of a blog post written in Markdown.

I can write about **code**, _design_, and everything in between.

## Why Astro?

Astro is fast, easy to use, and perfect for content-driven websites like this one.

### Code Example

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

Stay tuned for more!
