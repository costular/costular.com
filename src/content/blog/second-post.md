# The Future of Web Development

The web is constantly evolving. From static sites to SPAs and now back to static (but smarter) sites with islands architecture.

## Key Trends

1. **Performance First**: Core Web Vitals are crucial.
2. **Edge Computing**: Running code closer to the user.
3. **AI Integration**: Using LLMs to build better UIs.

The future looks bright!
